Distributed-Algorithms
======================

Abstractions of components of a distributed system to simulate implementations of distributed algorithms. 

Description
===========

The project aims to give a framework with proper abstractions of components in distributed systems like process, channel, messages, etc. to make it convenient to experiment with distributed algorithms.

Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 2.5.7. For details and usage
